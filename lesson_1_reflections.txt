How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It makes it easier to find differences in two versions, because you do not have to check the complete files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Some files may have a strong dependency between each other, so it makes sense to track changes in that bundle of files, rather then separating them. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The commit can be done in logical units of work, rather then in the middle of a task.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because i can access previous states in the code and check, if the bug already existed. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Learning Android an being able to control my versions of code.
